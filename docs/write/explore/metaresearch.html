<h1 id="meta-research-notes">Meta-research Notes</h1>
<h2 id="writing-style">Writing Style</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Justify every claim and choice by argument</strong>, which takes on one (or more) of the following types, in decreasing order of strength:
<ol type="1">
<li>Deduction from first principles (e.g., mathematical proof).</li>
<li>Abductive reasoning (e.g., strong experimental evidence).</li>
<li>Literature (e.g., following X et al.).</li>
<li>Bandwagoning (e.g., everybody uses this model).</li>
<li>Authority (e.g., Google did it).</li>
<li>Personal anecdote (e.g., our preliminary runs show this but no data given).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Use plain syntax.</strong> Readers are here to admire the problem and the solutions, not the prose.</li>
<li><strong>Use fun semantics.</strong> Make the problem and the solutions interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Move the related work section to the end.</strong> Placed in the beginning, the related work section is too incomprehensible for the reader, who knows nothing of your problem.</li>
<li><strong>Fold the background part into the methods section, where possible.</strong> The methodology section should always have justification regardless.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="experimental-style">Experimental Style</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pick a problem that satisfies the following properties:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Important</strong>: work on something that matters to many; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind">research isn’t done in a vacuum</a>. Always consider the implications of your claims and findings.</li>
<li><strong>Interesting</strong>: work on something that matters to you. If you don’t care about the success of a project, you won’t realize your potential.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic</strong>: <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/continually-aim-just-beyond-your-current-range/">work on something just outside your reach</a>. That way, you continually grow your realm of competence.</li>
<li><strong>Capturable</strong>: work on something whose solution’s value you can capture better than others. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">It’s about the size of the bite, not the size of the cake</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Identify critical points early.</strong> Which potential finding, if discovered, would result in a waste of time and effort? For example,
<ol type="1">
<li>Is my task interesting and my approach new? Do literature search before novel design.</li>
<li>Would baselines outperform my approach? Do baselines before novel methods.</li>
<li>Is this task beyond my current resources? Do planning before execution.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Abandon boring projects.</strong> If this project no longer excites you, you definitely won’t excite the reader, who might not be excited <em>even when</em> you are excited. Further, you won’t care if it gets published, and academia isn’t for prestige or wealth.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid security through obscurity.</strong> If your design has a potential flaw, you must either explicitly justify it or change it. It’s not only unethical but also pathetic to mislead yourself and others.</li>
</ol>
