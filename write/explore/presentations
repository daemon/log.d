# Presentation Notes
- The audience is sleepy -- stick to illustrations and concise messages.
- Highlight the most important phrases and clauses in the bullet points.
- A good talk anticipates the audience's questions, so they don't have to raise them.
- Assume that the audience will circulate the slides, so keep slides uncontroversial and self-contained.
