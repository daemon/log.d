# Proof Strategies

## General

- Construct an expression that's similar to (or part of) something in the premise, then directly relate it to another.
- A good proof by contradiction can't be easily transformed into a direct proof. It uses the contradiction to derive an alternate reality with extra information, which eventually proves to be incorrect.
- Don't blindly expand the syntax of an expression; instead, focus on its semantics.
  - A corollary is that the equivalent of rubber duck debugging won't get you anywhere.
- Textbook proofs are often too condensed to be informative. Instead, derive the proof yourself.
- Start with the belief that the claim is incorrect, then convince yourself that it's correct.
- Try iteratively refining a proof sketch until it's a rigorous proof, like animation storyboarding. This helps in particular when you're stuck, e.g., going from A to C may be easier than A to B to C, especially if B and C are unknown.
