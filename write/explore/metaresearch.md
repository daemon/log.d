# Meta-research Notes

## Personal Rules of Style

1. **Justify every claim and choice by argument**, which takes on one (or more) of the following types, in decreasing order of strength:
   1. Deduction from first principles (e.g., mathematical proof).
   2. Abductive reasoning (e.g., strong experimental evidence).
   3. Literature (e.g., following X et al.).
   4. Bandwagoning (e.g., everybody uses this model).
   5. Authority (e.g., Google did it).
   6. Personal anecdote (e.g., our preliminary runs show this but no data given).
2. **Use plain syntax.** Readers are here to admire the problem and the solutions, not the prose.
3. **Use fun semantics.** Make the problem and the solutions interesting.
4. **Move the related work section to the end.** Placed in the beginning, the related work section is too incomprehensible for the reader, who knows nothing of your problem.
5. **Fold the background part into the methods section, where possible.** The methodology section should always have justification regardless.
6. **Identify critical points early.** Which potential finding, if discovered, would result in a waste of time and effort? For example,
   1. Is my task interesting and my approach new? Do literature search before novel design.
   2. Would baselines outperform my approach? Do baselines before novel methods.
   3. Is this task beyond my current resources? Do planning before execution.
7. **Abandon boring projects.** If this project doesn't excite you, it won't excite the reader. Further, you won't care if it gets published, and academia isn't for prestige or wealth.
