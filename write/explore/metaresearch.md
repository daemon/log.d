# Meta-research Notes

## Writing Style

1. **Justify every claim and choice by argument**, which takes on one (or more) of the following types, in decreasing order of strength:
   1. Deduction from first principles (e.g., mathematical proof).
   2. Abductive reasoning (e.g., strong experimental evidence).
   3. Literature (e.g., following X et al.).
   4. Bandwagoning (e.g., everybody uses this model).
   5. Authority (e.g., Google did it).
   6. Personal anecdote (e.g., our preliminary runs show this but no data given).
2. **Use plain syntax.** Readers are here to admire the problem and the solutions, not the prose.
3. **Use fun semantics.** Make the problem and the solutions interesting.
4. **Move the related work section to the end.** Placed in the beginning, the related work section is too incomprehensible for the reader, who knows nothing of your problem.
5. **Fold the background part into the methods section, where possible.** The methodology section should always have justification regardless.

## Experimental Style

1. **Pick a problem that satisfies the following properties:** 
   1. **Important**: work on something that matters to many; [research isn't done in a vacuum](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind). Always consider the implications of your claims and findings.
   2. **Interesting**: work on something that matters to you. If you don't care about the success of a project, you won't realize your potential.
   3. **Realistic**: [work on something just outside your reach](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/continually-aim-just-beyond-your-current-range/). That way, you continually grow your realm of competence.
   4. **Capturable**: work on something whose solution's value you can capture better than others. [It's about the size of the bite, not the size of the cake](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296).
2. **Identify critical points early.** Which potential finding, if discovered, would result in a waste of time and effort? For example,
   1. Is my task interesting and my approach new? Do literature search before novel design.
   2. Would baselines outperform my approach? Do baselines before novel methods.
   3. Is this task beyond my current resources? Do planning before execution.
3. **Abandon boring projects.** If this project no longer excites you, you definitely won't excite the reader, who might not be excited _even when_ you are excited. Further, you won't care if it gets published, and academia isn't for prestige or wealth.
4. **Avoid security through obscurity.** If your design has a potential flaw, you must either explicitly justify it or change it. It's not only unethical but also pathetic to mislead yourself and others.
